# Game in Java that is Top Down
Started making a simple game in java but couldn't come up with a proper name.

## What version of java does it run?
Runs in regular old java (21.0.1 I think?)

## What is it even?
basicly a 2d topdown mincraft clone but you're constrained to a grid. Like minecraft but chess. 

## When will it be done?
when I feel like it

## Can I take the code/assets?
I don't know why you would want to but sure.
